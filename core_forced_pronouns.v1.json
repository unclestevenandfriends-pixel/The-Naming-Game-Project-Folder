Always apply via a context rule (pattern/gate) first.\n2) Apply multi-word phrases BEFORE single-word matching.\n3) Preserve existing correct casing; only upgrade casing (lower → Title Case / UPPER) when a rule triggers.\n4) Prefer \"places\" over \"people names\" (names cause false positives: May/Will/Rose/Mark/etc.).\n5) British English default (en-GB). No Oxford comma enforcement via these lists.\n6) Lists are whitelists only; they do not imply the text is correct or that punctuation should be inserted.\n7) Version these files. If filename changes (e.g., v1→v2), browsers will refetch; otherwise rely on cache.\n",
